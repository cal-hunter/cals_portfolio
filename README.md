### ðŸ”¹ [Mental-Health-SQL-Queries](https://github.com/cal-hunter/Mental-Health-SQL-Queries)
**Tools:** SQL

## Summary  
This project analyzes global anxiety and depression trends from 1990 to 2019, focusing on identifying treatment gaps across different countries. Using SQL, I extracted insights from multiple datasets, examining prevalence, treatment access, and disease burden to highlight critical areas for intervention.

## Highlights  
- Used `GROUP BY` and aggregation to analyze mental health trends over time  
- Enhanced queries with Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for better readability  
- Calculated relative percentage changes to identify clinically significant trends  
- Paired anxiety trends with treatment access to flag countries with severe gaps
